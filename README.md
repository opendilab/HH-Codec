## Installation
To install HHCodec, follow these steps:
```python
conda create -n hhcodec python=3.10 # it must >3.10 beacause use bigvgan
conda activate hhcodec
git clone https://github.com/opendilab/HH-Codec.git
cd HH-Codec 
pip install -e .

#if you want to eval by UTMOS
pip install pip==24.0
pip install fairseq
```
## Train

### Step 1: Prepare the Training Dataset
Ensure your dataset is preprocessed by following the instructions in [`dataset`](dataset)

### Step 2: Modify Configuration Files
Before starting training, update the configuration settings
```python
# Open and modify the following file "configs/train.yaml"
# Adjust parameters such as:
# - log settings
# - train_path
# - save_dir
# - device (e.g., CPU/GPU)
```

### Step 3: Start Training
Once the dataset is prepared and the configuration is set, launch the training process:
```python
#We expect to finalize and open-source the training code within two weeks.
```
